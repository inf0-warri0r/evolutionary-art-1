evolutionary art generator
============================

this application generates images using neural network
and a genetic algorithm. each pixel of the image is desided by
the neural network and the network is trained using a genetic
algorithm.

first it generates 10 random sets of weights for 10 neural nets.
then each net generate an image. each image is given a random marks 
(0 - 100) or the user is asked to give a mark (0 - 100). then
the next genartion is generated according to that marks.


running the app
-----------------

you need to install 'python' and 'Tkinter' libraries to run the app.
after installing them use command,

python main.py

to run the app. in the application gui you can use eather 'vote mode'
or 'random mode' to run (check the vote mode check box for 'vote mode' and
un check it to use 'random mode'). choose one and press 'start'. if you use
random the app will run by itself. if you use 'vote mode' you have to write 
your mark for each art in vote 'text box' and press 'vote' button to get to
next image.
